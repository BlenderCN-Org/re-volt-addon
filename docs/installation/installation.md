To install the add-on, locate the `addons` folder within your Blender folder.

In most cases, it is located at `C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.79\scripts\addons`.

If you're on Linux, your add-on folder might be located at `~/.config/blender/2.79/scripts/addons/`, where `2.79` is the **Blender version you are using**.  

Extract the `io_revolt` folder into the addons folder.
