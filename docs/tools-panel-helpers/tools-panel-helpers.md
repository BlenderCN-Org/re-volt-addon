## 3D View

### Texture
Enables the regular texture mode (no shading, flat textures).

### Textured Solid
Enables solid mode and textured solid mode (shading and textures). This is useful for working on textured and untextured models at the same time.


## Instances

### Rename selected
Renames all objects to the entered text (for example test.prm, test.prm.001, test.prm.002, ...). This is useful for exporting objects as instances. The prm ending is not necessary as it will be ignored when exporting.
