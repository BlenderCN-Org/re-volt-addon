# Properties Editor

![Properties Editor](./properties/img/editor.png)

The properties Editor is usually found at the right hand side of the user interface.

Most Re-Volt properties can be found in the **Object** tab (orange cube icon).

Some properties from Blender are used as well, such as vertex colors.
Vertex color layers can be found in the object data section (symbol with three dots).
