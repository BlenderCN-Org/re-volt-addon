Vertex colors will be set depending on the selection mode.  
Vertex, edge and face select modes (`CTRL` `TAB`) each have different effects.

## Color Wheel

An easy to access color selector to select the color hue and shade.  
The *Set Color* button sets the color to the selected faces.  
Click on the color preview to the left of the *Set Color* button to get a more detailed color wheel that supports RBG, HSV and Hex values and a color picker.  
*Get Color from active Face* copies the average vertex color of the active face to the color wheel.

## Shade buttons

These buttons can be used for easily shading a mesh. They range from black to white.
