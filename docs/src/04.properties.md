## Properties

### Object Properties

This panel is at the far bottom of the Object section of the object properties.

Some properties from Blender are used as well, such as vertex colors.
Vertex color layers can be found in the object data section (symbol with three dots).

**Big Cube Properties**:  
This only shows when a big cube is selected.

**Mesh Indices**:  
A list of mesh indices the selected big cubes belongs to. Does not affect

### Scene Properties

**Re-Volt .w Properties**:  
This panel is at the far bottom of the Scene section of the Properties editor.

**Texture Animations**:  
Texture animation dictionaries for .w files saved as a string. This property can be edited with the texture animation panel in edit mode.


### Mesh Properties

#### Vertex Colors

Generally, meshes can have the following vertex color layers:

**Col**: The color/shade  
**Alpha**: The translucency of the vertex/polygon. White is completely opaque (visible), black is completely transparent (invisible). This layer will only be used if the *translucent* flag is set in the face properties.  
**Env**: The environment color (reflection). This layer is used for meshes and polygons of .w files. The env flag needs to be set in order for faces to use it.
